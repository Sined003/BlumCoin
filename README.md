## Overview

BlumCoin is a JavaScript project designed to automate interactions with the Blum Coin ecosystem. This "Auto Click" bot automates repetitive actions such as token claiming, buying, or other on-chain interactions related to Blum Coin.

---

## Features

- Automates clicking or transaction sending for Blum Coin
- Written entirely in JavaScript
- Easy to customize and extend for your use case
- MIT licensed open source project

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- Internet connection to access the blockchain RPC endpoint
- A funded wallet (if transactions require signing)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sined003/BlumCoin.git
   cd BlumCoin
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):

## Usage

Run the main script to start the auto click bot:

```
node b.js
```

The script will connect to the Blum Coin smart contract or relevant blockchain endpoint and automate the configured interactions.

## How It Works

- Connects to the blockchain network where Blum Coin operates.
- Uses JavaScript to send transactions or interact with the smart contract.
- Automates repetitive tasks that would otherwise require manual clicking or interaction.
